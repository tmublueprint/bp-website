// Implement the WorkCarouselCard component
// Reference Zeplin General Page for the design specs
// Functionalities:
// - The carousel should display template projects for now
// - The carousel should be able to scroll through the projects vertically through button clicks
// - The carousel should occasionally scroll through the projects automatically
// For now, not necessary to include links to each project page

function WorkCarouselCard() {
    // Code goes here

    return (
        <>
        </>
    )
}

export default WorkCarouselCard;
