Our website! (Coming soon)

Keeping this private for now, at least until we add a license to it and host it.
A few things need to be decided before work truely begins on the website, namely:
- Framework (are we going to use one/ which one. I know react was brough up at the first meeting)
- Design (What will the website look like)
- Functionality Prioritization (What functions does our website need to preform and what is more important)
